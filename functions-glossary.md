Below is a description of the algorithms found in this library:

``` findAnagrams```: searches a string against another string or array of strings and returns an array of those that are anagrams.

```sortWord```: takes a string and returns the string sorted alphabetically.

```randBetween```: generates a random number between a given minimum and maximum, with options to specify exclusivity and whether to allow decimal values.
