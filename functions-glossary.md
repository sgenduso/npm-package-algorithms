Below is a description of the algorithms found in this library:

```factorial```: returns the factorial of a given integer.

``` findAnagrams```: searches a string against another string or array of strings and returns an array of those that are anagrams.

```findCount```: takes 2 strings and returns the number of times the first appears in the second.

```gigasecond```: takes a date and returns a date a gigasecond in the future (11,574 days).

```isAnagram```: takes 2 words and returns a boolean of whether they are anagrams of each other (contain exactly the same letters but are not the same word)

```isPalindrome```: takes a string and returns a boolean of whether it is a palindrome.

```isPangram```: takes a string and returns a boolean of whether it is a pangram (whether it contains every letter of the alphabet).

```isPrime```: takes an integer and returns a boolean of whether it is prime.

```randBetween```: generates a random number between a given minimum and maximum, with options to specify exclusivity and whether to allow decimal values.

```romanToArabic```: takes a roman numeral string and returns the equivalent value as an arabic number.

```search```: takes a string and an array (or another string) and returns an array of all values that contain the string. Includes options for fuzzy matching.

```sortWord```: takes a string and returns the string sorted alphabetically.

```sumMatrices```: takes 2 matrices of integers and returns a matrix of the sum of integers at respective indeces.

```transpose```: transposes columns in a given array of arrays.

 ```wordCount```: takes a string and returns an object where the key is the word and the value is the amount of times that word appears in the string.
