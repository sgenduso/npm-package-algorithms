Below is a description of the algorithms found in this library:

```arrayDifff```: filters all values that appear in one array (b) out of another array (a) and returns  new array with these values removed.

```calculateHypotenuse```: finds the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle given the lengths of the other 2 sides.

```factorial```: returns the factorial of a given integer.

```filterType```: filters all elements of a specific type out of an array and returns a new array with these elements removed.

``` findAnagrams```: searches a string against another string or array of strings and returns an array of those that are anagrams.

```findCount```: takes 2 strings and returns the number of times the first appears in the second.

```gigasecond```: takes a date and returns a date a gigasecond in the future (11,574 days).

```generatePassword```: takes a string (expects a sentence) and returns a strong password which combines the input with special characters and numbers.

```isAnagram```: takes 2 words and returns a boolean of whether they are anagrams of each other (contain exactly the same letters but are not the same word)

```isPalindrome```: takes a string and returns a boolean of whether it is a palindrome.

```isPangram```: takes a string and returns a boolean of whether it is a pangram (whether it contains every letter of the alphabet).

```isPrime```: takes an integer and returns a boolean of whether it is prime.

```isSquare```: takes an integer and returns a boolean of whether it is a perfect square.

```lp100kmTompg```: converts liters/100km to miles/gallon.

```mpgTolp100km```: converts miles/gallon to liters/100km.

```queryParser ```: takes in a query string returns an object where the key is item before the equals and the value is the item after.

```randBetween```: generates a random number between a given minimum and maximum, with options to specify exclusivity and whether to allow decimal values.

```romanToArabic```: takes a roman numeral string and returns the equivalent value as an arabic number.

```search```: takes a string and an array (or another string) and returns an array of all values that contain the string. Includes options for fuzzy matching.

```shuffle```: takes a string and returns a string of the same letters shuffled around.

```sortWord```: takes a string and returns the string sorted alphabetically.

```sumMatrices```: takes 2 matrices of integers and returns a matrix of the sum of integers at respective indeces.

```transpose```: transposes columns in a given array of arrays.

 ```wordCount```: takes a string and returns an object where the key is the word and the value is the amount of times that word appears in the string.
