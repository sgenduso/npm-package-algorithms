Write a function that detects anagrams.

IT:
  * takes two arguments: a word and an array of words
  * returns an array of words that are anagrams of the given word
  * does not return anagram subsets (given “good” should not return “dog” or “goody”)
  * is case insensitive
  * does not detect itself as an anagram (given “hello” should not return “hello”)
