This function returns the factorial of a given integer.  Factorials cannot be calculated on negative or fractional numbers like floats.  

IT:
  * Takes one argument: A whole, positive, integer
  * Returns the product of the factorial
  * Cannot accept Floats or Negative Numbers. Doing so causes stack overflow.
